# Unexpected behavior with Tailwind CSS classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS. The issue involves unexpected behavior when applying specific Tailwind CSS classes to a div element.  The text within the div element does not render as expected, although the class names appear to be valid and correctly applied.

## Bug Description
The `bg-gray-300`, `p-4`, and `rounded-lg` classes are applied to a div element, and the expected behavior is for the text to be displayed within a gray background, with appropriate padding and rounded corners. However, the actual behavior deviates from this expectation.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. To reproduce the bug, simply include and run the code in your project using Tailwind CSS. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code. The fix may involve adjusting the order of classes, adding necessary parent containers, or addressing conflicts with other CSS styles.
